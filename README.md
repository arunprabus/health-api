## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 RESTful API built with **Express.js**
- 🛡️ Middleware support for JSON parsing, CORS, etc.
- 🐳 Dockerized for consistent deployment
- 🔧 Environment-specific config via environment variables
- ✅ Built with future integration in mind (e.g., DB, Auth, Storage)

## 🔧 Configuration

The app uses **environment variables** for configuration. Common variables include:

```env
PORT=8080
API_BASE_PATH=/api
NODE_ENV=production
```

For local development, create a `.env` file in the root:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Usage

### 1. Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t health-api .
```

### 2. Run the container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080   -e PORT=8080   -e API_BASE_PATH=/api   health-api
```

---

## 🧪 Local Development

Install dependencies and start the server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This uses `nodemon` for auto-restart on file changes.

---

## 🔌 API Structure

- `GET /api/health` – Basic health check endpoint
- Add your domain-specific endpoints under `src/routes/`

---

## 🌐 Deployment Notes

- Built for integration with frontend apps and orchestration tools (Docker Compose, Kubernetes)
- Can be configured to connect to external services (DB, auth, etc.)
