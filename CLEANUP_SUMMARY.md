# Infrastructure Cleanup Summary

## Removed Components

### 1. Kubernetes Configuration (k8s/)
- deployment.yaml - Full K8s deployment config
- service.yaml - K8s service definition  
- ingress.yaml - K8s ingress with ALB annotations
- secrets.yaml - K8s secrets template

**Reason**: Appears unused since you're using Docker Compose for deployment

### 2. Complex GitHub Actions
- deploy.yml - Over-engineered EKS deployment workflow

**Reason**: Simplified to basic CI workflow only

### 3. Redundant Health Check
- healthcheck.js - Standalone health check file

**Reason**: Health check already implemented in docker-compose.yml

## Kept Components

- docker-compose.yml - Primary deployment method
- Dockerfile - Container definition
- .github/workflows/ci.yml - Basic CI pipeline
- All application source code and tests

## Next Steps

1. Update documentation to reflect simplified deployment
2. Consider if you need any of the removed components for production
3. Clean up any references to removed files in documentation
